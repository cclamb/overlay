# A log factory is responsible for assembling loggers, both
# local and distributed.
class Garden::Domain::Factories::LogFactory

  # We initialize the factory with the name of the bucket
  # to use for distributed logging.  This could potentially
  # be done such that the bucket name is submitted on creation,
  # allowing for creation of multiple arbitrary logs, where
  # each log is keyed by the bucket name, but that's advanced
  # functionality we don't need at this point.  You could
  # take the same approach for local logs as well.
