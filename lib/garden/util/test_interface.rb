# This is a test interface we include with various
# sintra component servers.  It supplies some simple
# endpoints for sanity testing to ensure that HTTP
# servers are up with basic functionality.

# This allows us to use the Sinatra DSL within specific class
# files, but still maintain appropriate cohesion in server
# classes.

  # We have a basic index template defined in the data
  # segment of this class, at the end of this file.  In
  # order to use that template, we must enable inline
  # template processing.  This template is returned whenever
