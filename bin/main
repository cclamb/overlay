# This is the network overlay system.
# 
# == The primary program entry point (bin/main)
# This is the main program entry point for the overlay system.
# This executable is designed to be called from capistrano,
# after which it will:
# * Grab the network configuration document from S3
# * Bootstrap the network with contained information
#   - This will contain info describing the repository to use
#   - Contains all information to configure the network 
# * Begin waiting for requests
#
# The configuration file is indexed by hostname and contains
# all needed context information as well as information with
# respect to the information repository to download and use.
#
# This expects four arguments.  They are, in order:
# * The URL of the configuration document generated from S3
# * The S3 access key
# * The S3 secret key
# * The S3 location to log overlay specific operational state
