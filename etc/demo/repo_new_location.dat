        During the final days of the Vietnam war, three soldiers were ordered to rob the Bank of Hanoi. However, the man who ordered them was killed and noone else can verify their story. They would be tried and found guilty but after that they escape from the facility where they were being held and went underground in Los Angeles. They then established themselves as Soldiers of Fortune known as The A Team. Their leader is Colonel John "Hannibal" Smith who is a master of disguises and has a penchant for danger, who works as an actor, who takes on roles that require him to wear either heavy make up or a costume. B.A.(Bad Attitude) Baracas has a penchant for striking anyone who rubs him the wrong way and is so afraid to fly that they have to drug to get him on a plane and is also a mechanical genius, and Templeton "Face Man" Peck, who is so good looking that he can charm anyone into giving them what they need.  H.M. (Howling Mad) Murdock flew for them when they were in Vietnam but was not with them when they robbed the bank, who is so shell shocked by the war that he is confined to a V.A. psychiatric hospital, and Face has to come up with all sorts of excuses to get him released so that he could fly for them.

        Initially, they were being hunted down by Colonel Lynch, whose facility they broke out of, he would later be replaced by Colonel Decker, who is more aggressive. A few years later, Decker would be replaced by General Fullbright. Eventually the team would be caught by a man named Stockwell, who runs a covert spy network, and who promised them a pardon if they join his team and carry out some (dangerous) missions. Frankie Santana, a special effects man who worked with Hannibal in the movies also joined them after helping them.
