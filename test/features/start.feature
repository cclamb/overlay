Feature: Starting an overlay network

  In typical usage we need to be able to start a given overlay network from a centralized location.  We should be able to do this without a centralized log, but we should always have a configured system log.

  Scenario: Network already running
  Scenario: Bad network configuration
  Scenario: No centralized log destination specified
  Scenario: Hierarchical network
  Scenario: Non-hierarchical network
